```NPM Setup```
First, install NPM. Then run `NPM i` and finally install Nodemon `npm i -g nodemon`. When running the PoyoWeb, do `node .` in the PoyoWeb's `index.js` directory. For development purposes, run `nodemon .` in the same directory as the PoyoWeb's `index.js`.

# Nginx Setup
For nginx you gotta copy the files from /nginx to wherever your nginx stuff is
```sudo cp nginx/maintenance.html /usr/share/nginx/html/```

# How it works
The PoyoWeb is a node.js app.
